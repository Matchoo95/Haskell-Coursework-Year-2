# Haskell-Coursework-Year-2
Your task is to write a program in Haskell for a film ratings website that lets users add films, say which films they like, and display the details of various films. The site maintains a “database” (a textfile) of many films; each record of which gives a film’s title, the director, the year of release, and a list of users of the website who are fans of the film. 

You should begin by developing purely functional code to cover the core functionality, and then add to this the functions/actions that will comprise the program’s user interface. You may assume that no two films have the same title – i.e. any film can be uniquely identified by its title.
